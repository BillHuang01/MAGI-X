# MAGI-X

This repository provides the PyTorch implementation of MAGI-X, an extension of the MAnifold-constrained Gaussian process Inference ([MAGI][1]) for learning unknown ODEs system, where the associated derivative function does not have known parametric form. 

Our paper is available on [arXiv][2]. If you found this repository useful in your research, please consider citing
